Some tips:
	- Install all these libraries to one folder, for example C:\gamedev
	- Premake4 will make sure that your solution has all the right paths in it
	- Premake4 will also handle linking the correct .lib or .dll, depending on what's present on your machine
	- You'll need to rebuild some libraries
	- An development installer for everything show here will be created once we know exactly what libraries we'll need. Untill then, this file will change once in a while
	- An shipment installer for the final product will be created as well, containing the minimum of the needed files in order to play the game

1) set up git
	- Git: http://git-scm.com/download/win
	- GitExtensions: http://gitextensions.googlecode.com/files/GitExtensions241SetupComplete.msi
	- set up ssh files
	
2) clone repository
	- git@denethor.bfh.ch:shader-development--bachelor-thesis.git
	- Make sure there are no spaces in the path to the git repository on your machine
		- Ogre has some problems with spaces, mainly in resource loading
	
3) Download and install premake4 (put it in the project directory, created in step 2)
	- http://sourceforge.net/projects/premake/files/Premake/4.4/premake-4.4-beta4-windows.zip/download
	
4) Download and install CMAKE
	- http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.8/cmake-2.8.9-win32-x86.exe
	
5) Download and install BOOST
	- http://boostpro.com/download/boost_1_47_setup.exe
	
6) Download and install OGRE
	- http://sourceforge.net/projects/ogre/files/ogre/1.7/OgreSDK_vc10_v1-7-4.exe/download
	
7) Download and install Bullet
	- http://bullet.googlecode.com/files/bullet-2.80-rev2531.zip
	- Build using CMAKE
	
8) install SFML
	- http://switch.dl.sourceforge.net/project/sfml/sfml/1.6/SFML-1.6-sdk-windows-vc2008.zip
	- Rebuild using VS 2010
	
9) Set up Enviroment variables
	- OGRE_HOME -> Points to the ogre sdk 
		- example C:\OgreSDK_vc10_v1-7-4
		
	- GAMEDEV_LIBS -> Points to a folder containing ALL external libraries
		- most important: SFML, Bullet, Boost
		- example C:\gamedev
		
10) Run Premake4
	- Open CMD
	- Run premake4.exe
		- This will generate a Visual Studio 2010 Solution

11) Build and run the game from Visual Studio

FAQ:
Q: When I run the game, the error message "Can't find libdsd1.dll" cannot be found" appears. How do I fix this?
A: This is a missing external library. It's located within SFML-1.6\extlibs\bin. Simply copy it to the OGRE debug binaries (OgreSdk\bin\debug)
