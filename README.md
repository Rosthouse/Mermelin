This project is the Bachelor Thesis I did in 2013. The target was to create a game engine to explore the workings of GLSL Shaders.

The engine is multiplatform (currently supporting Windows and Linux) and made completly with Open Source libraries, such as:

* [Ogre3D](http://www.ogre3d.org/)
* [Bullet Physics Engine](http://bulletphysics.org/wordpress/)
* [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
* [Object Oriented Input System](http://sourceforge.net/projects/wgois/)
* [libRocket GUI](http://librocket.com/)
* [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/)

The engine borrows several concepts out of the book [Game Engine Architecture](http://www.gameenginebook.com/) by Jason Gregory.

For a complete documentation of this project, I've uploaded the[ bachelor thesis documentation](media/documentation/Thesis.pdf). Mind you, it is in German.
